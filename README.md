# Expo ImagePicker Undefined URI Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo ImagePicker library where the image URI is sometimes returned as undefined, especially when selecting multiple images. The bug causes app crashes or unexpected behavior due to attempts to access undefined properties.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3.  Run the app: `expo start`.
4. Select one or more images using the ImagePicker.
5. Observe that some URIs may be undefined, causing errors. 

## Solution

The provided solution implements error handling to check for undefined URIs before attempting to access them. This prevents crashes and ensures robust image handling.

## Additional Notes

This bug seems to be intermittent and platform-dependent. It might be related to issues with image loading or permissions.  Further investigation may be required for a complete fix.
